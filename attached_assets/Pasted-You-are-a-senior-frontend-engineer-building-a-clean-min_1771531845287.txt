You are a senior frontend engineer building a clean, minimal hackathon dashboard.

Project name: Mission Control – AI Assistant for Team Leads

The goal is to build a single-page dashboard that aggregates signals from:
	•	Emails
	•	Slack / messages
	•	Project updates (Jira)
	•	Deadlines

The dashboard should NOT separate content by tool.
Instead, it should present a unified AI-prioritized view, with optional filters.

Keep the UI modern, minimal, and executive-level.

⸻

🏗 Tech Stack
	•	React
	•	TypeScript
	•	TailwindCSS
	•	Simple chart library (Recharts)
	•	Backend: FastAPI (REST returning JSON)

Use clean, modular component structure.

⸻

🎨 Design Principles
	•	Minimal and focused
	•	Clear visual hierarchy
	•	Calm UI with subtle alert colors
	•	Important signals stand out
	•	No clutter
	•	No excessive animations
	•	Feels like an executive briefing

⸻

📊 Dashboard Layout

Create a single page with the following sections:

⸻

1️⃣ Snapshot Summary (Top Row)

Display 4 metric cards:
	•	🔥 Urgent Items (number)
	•	⚠️ Risks Detected (number)
	•	📅 Upcoming Deadlines (number)
	•	📊 Execution Health (Good / Stable / At Risk)

Keep these compact and visually clean.

⸻

2️⃣ Important Signals (Main Section – Unified View)

This is the core section.

Display AI-prioritized signal cards aggregated from all tools.

Each card must show:
	•	Title
	•	Source badge (Email / Slack / Jira)
	•	Category badge (Urgent / Deadline / Blocker / Update)
	•	Short AI summary (2 lines max)
	•	Urgency level (color coded)
	•	Deadline (if applicable)

Cards should be scannable and clean.

⸻

Filter Bar (Above Important Signals)

Add simple filter chips:

Filter by Source:
[ All ] [ Email ] [ Slack ] [ Jira ]

Filter by Category:
[ All ] [ Urgent ] [ Deadlines ] [ Blockers ] [ Updates ]

Filters should dynamically filter the signal list.

Default view = All.

⸻

3️⃣ Latest Activity Feed (Small Section)

A lightweight chronological list showing:
	•	Short message/update preview
	•	Source badge
	•	Timestamp

This is not prioritized — just awareness.

Keep it compact.

⸻

4️⃣ Emerging Risks

Display a highlighted insight card with:
	•	AI-generated risk summary paragraph

Example:

“Repeated blocker mentions in API integration and two deadline shifts detected this week.”

This should visually stand out but remain minimal.

⸻

5️⃣ Execution Health (Team Efficiency)

Keep this simple.

Display:
	•	Small 7-day sentiment trend line chart
	•	2–3 bullet insights such as:
	•	“Blocker mentions increased this week.”
	•	“Urgency signals trending upward.”
	•	“No major overload patterns detected.”

Do NOT show individual productivity metrics.

This section reflects operational stability, not employee scoring.

⸻

6️⃣ Recommended Actions (High Importance)

Display 3 AI-recommended actions.

Each action card should show:
	•	Title
	•	Short explanation
	•	Priority label (High / Medium / Low)

This section should feel like:
“AI briefing the team lead.”
